# [Oppia Android](https://www.oppia.org) ![CI Lint and Tests](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/workflows/CI%20Lint%20and%20Tests/badge.svg) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/oppia/oppia-android.svg)](https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-android?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback.

The Android app is a new, not-yet-released frontend for Oppia that provides access to Oppia's curated numeracy lessons for users who may not have regular access to internet connectivity, and in a way that can be easily shared across multiple members of the same household.

Oppia Android is written using Kotlin and Java, and leverages Bazel, data-binding, Dagger 2, and AndroidX. See also:
